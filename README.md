## Links
* [GitHub - jQuery Homework Link](https://github.com/GRowe22/hw_jquery_rowe_greg)


## Resources
* [Category Manipulation](http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/) I used the jQeury site to get a little more information on manipulation.



## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.


## Comments
* This one was quite a bit easier to follow along (probably evident by my lack of a million questions), I really like the shortened code.
* This will also take some getting used to, but at the moment seems a little easier to get a handle on than straight JavaScript.
